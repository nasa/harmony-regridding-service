# Change Log

The Harmony Regridding Service follows semantic versioning. All notable changes
to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [v1.0.1] - 2024-06-20

### Changed
This version of the Harmony Regridding Service updates to use Python 3.11.

## [v1.0.0] -  2024-04-12

This version of the Harmony Regridding Service contains all functionality
previously released internally to EOSDIS as `sds/harmony-regridder:0.0.4`.
Minor reformatting of the repository structure has occurred to comply with
recommended best practices for a Harmony backend service repository, but the
service itself is functionally unchanged. Additional contents to the repository
include updated documentation and files outlined by the
[NASA open-source guidelines](https://code.nasa.gov/#/guide).

For more information on internal releases prior to NASA open-source approval,
see legacy-CHANGELOG.md.
