    "# Harmony Regridding Service\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contact:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Slack:** #harmony_service_providers\n",
    "* **Jira:** [SDPS Data Services](https://bugs.earthdata.nasa.gov/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=757&view=planning.nodetail)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Harmony Regridding Service?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Harmony Regridding Services is a [Harmony](https://harmony.earthdata.nasa.gov) backend service that transforms the data within a specified input granule to a single geographic grid. The initial version of this service is only compatible with geographic source and target grids. The transformed output is returned to the user in the form of a standard Harmony STAC object, which contains links to the output granule in an AWS S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Harmony Regridding Service leverages the `earthdata-varinfo` Python package (see: [here](https://github.com/nasa/earthdata-varinfo)) to map variable dependencies and group variables by horizontal spatial dimensions. `pyresample` (see [here](https://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) is used to perform the resampling in a horizontal spatial plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transforming a granule with data in one or more geographic grids to another, single target geographic grid.\n",
    "* Can handle N-dimensional input variables (e.g., those with only horizontal spatial dimesions, or also those with temporal and/or vertical spatial dimensions, etc).\n",
    "* Preservation of file variable hierarchy.\n",
    "* NetCDF-4 output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* L3 or L4 data, on one or more geographic grid(s).\n",
    "* NetCDF-4 file format.\n",
    "* A UMM-S record associated with the UMM-C record(s) for applicable collection(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Harmony Regridding Service processes a request\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Harmony Regridding Service receives a Harmony message, including `scaleExtent` and either `scaleSize` or `height` and `width`.\n",
    "* The service validates that sufficient information exists to define the target grid, and that the grid is self-consistent (e.g., `scaleSize.x = (scaleExtent.x.max - scaleExtent.x.min) / width`).\n",
    "* A `pyresample` [AreaDefinition](https://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/geo_def.html#areadefinition) is created for the horizontal spatial dimensions of the target grid.\n",
    "* The service identifies all combinations of horizontal spatial dimensions used for gridded dimensions. A `pyresample` [DaskEWAResampler](https://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/swath.html#resampler) is created for each pair of horizontal spatial dimensions.\n",
    "* The weights from the input grids to the target grid are calculated for each `DaskEWAResampler`, using the Elliptical Weighted Averaging methodology. (For non-elliptical grids, the ellipses are circular)\n",
    "* The weights for each `DaskEWAResampler` object are applied to each applicable variable, and the output variables are written to an output file. This output file will also contain new 1-D dimension variables, describing the horizontal spatial dimensions of the target grid, along with the target CRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples use `harmony-py` (see: [here](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-py)) to make requests to Harmony. `harmony-py` is distributed via the Python Package Index (PyPI), and can be installed to your current Python environment via Pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install harmony-py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Python requirements are listed in `docs/pip_requirements.txt`. It is recommended to install all required packages via the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ conda create --name regridder-demo python=3.11 --channel conda-forge --channel defaults -y\n",
    "$ conda activate regridder-demo\n",
    "$ pip install -r pip_requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The requests below process data from the MERRA-2 hourly time-averaged collection ([M2T1NXSLV](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1276812863-GES_DISC.html)), containing air temperature, wind components, pressure and precipitation related variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the input data, with a single time slice for the specific humidity at 850 hPa. The input grid has a longitudinal resolution of 0.625 degrees east, and a latitudinal resolution of 0.5 degrees north.\n",
